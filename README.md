Warp Categories are utilized to organize Warps, all of which have Customizeable icons, descriptions, etc. that are developed in-game by the server staff.

Warp Categories carry overall permissions to deny Players access to entire categories at once.

Individual Warps require specific permissions. The permission for a warp is `warps.teleport.<warp>`, where <warp> is the internal name for the warp.
