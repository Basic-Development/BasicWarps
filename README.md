Warp Categories are utilized to organize Warps, all of which have Customizable icons, descriptions, etc. that are developed in-game by the server staff.

Warp Categories carry overall permissions to deny Players access to entire categories at once. The permission required to use warps in a particular category is `warps.category.<category>`, where `<category>` is the internal name for a category.

Individual Warps require specific permissions. The permission for a warp is `warps.warp.<warp>`, where `<warp>` is the internal name for the warp.
